        <p><strong>Spaghetti all'Amatriciana</strong></p>
        <p>Spaghetti all'amatriciana is a true Italian classic. The traditional recipe
             calls for guanciale, a sort of bacon that comes from the 
             fat around the pig's cheek. In a pinch, you can replace it
              with smoked pancetta or bacon. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti </li>
            <li>Â¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil </li>
            <li>7 ounces guanciale (cured pork cheek), cut into strips </li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped </li>
            <li>1 fresh red chile pepper, chopped </li>
            <li>1 (18 ounce) can whole plum tomatoes, coarsely chopped </li>
            <li>3 cups grated pecorino Romano cheese </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. 
                Add guanciale; cook and stir until sizzling, about 5 minutes. Add onion and chile pepper; cook and stir until softened, about 10 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; simmer until tomatoes break down into a sauce, about 20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir spaghetti into the tomato sauce until well combined. Sprinkle generous amounts of pecorino Romano cheese over each serving.</li>
        </ol>
